# 1-2-bit-Predictors
The program demonstrates the use of 1-bit and 2-bit saturating counters for bimodal branch prediction.

## Results
The folder `10M accuracies` contains the results for the 1-bit and 2-bit branch predictors on the gcc-10M trace file, respectively.

## Reference
The documentation for the trace parser and the gcc-10M trace file can be found [here](https://acg.cis.upenn.edu/milom/cis501-Fall10/traces/trace-format.html).
